
Greetings!  

These JSON files are also located in the directory for the utils package (com.monica.alex.animaename.util):

- FirstNameMap.json
- MiddleNameMap.json
- LastNameMap.json

They were copied to this directory to work around an issue that was encountered while testing after deployment to AWS cloud.
Since these files are read from the JAR file, in order for the class that is reading the files to locate them
they must reside in the same JAR directory.
The app generated a "file not found" exception while I was testing after deploying.
This error did not occur when tested locally in the IDE. ( Makes life more interesting, right? :-)

At the moment, this was the simplest solution, given the time constraints.
I will revisit a approach in a later iteration of this code.
